# BiPlane-Maya-Animation
An exercise evaluating technical understanding of path animation and motion tangent manipulation in Maya

This exercise was to attach the rig of an airplane to a path with an animation duration of 300 frames. Then, set keys along the path by keyframing the uValue of the motion path at the given values in a specific order, listed below. The animation, once complete, will be nonsensical in motion. The exercise is designed to evaluate technical understanding of path animation and motion tangent manipulation.

Key Position                      In Tangent                    Out Tangent
     1                                none                        fast out
    60                               slow in                     stepped out
    90                              stepped in                    slow out
    150                              fast in                      fast out
    190                              slow in                      slow out
    240                              slow in                      linear out 
    300                              linear in                     none
